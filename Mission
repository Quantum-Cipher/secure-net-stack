## Mission

The mission of **Secure Net Stack** is to provide a **modular, secure, and extensible Python framework** for building encrypted network nodes and communication systems.  
We aim to create a foundation where developers, researchers, and open-source contributors can **experiment, innovate, and collaborate** on secure networking protocols, peer-to-peer architectures, and decentralized systems.  

By combining modular design, unit-tested components, and clear documentation, Secure Net Stack empowers the community to **build, extend, and share secure networked applications** efficiently and safely.
